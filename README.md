# LangChain.js Practice Repository  

This repository contains my practice code while learning **LangChain.js** from [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/build-llm-apps-with-langchain-js/). I am following along with the instructor and implementing various LangChain.js concepts in JavaScript.  

## Topics Covered  
- Basics of LangChain.js  
- Chains and Agents  
- Memory and Persistence  
- Working with LLMs  
- API Integrations  
- And more...  

## API Key Management  
I am utilizing **GitHub Models** to securely access and integrate OpenAIâ€™s **GPT-4o** within my practice implementations.  

This repository will be updated as I progress through the course.
